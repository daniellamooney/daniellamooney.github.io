      <p><b> The World is Too Much With Us </b>
      <br>Mythopoesis in Daniella Mooney's Golden Age Rising 
      <br>By Donovan Greef</p>

      <p><i>"Down below, the broad, roaring waves of the sea break against the deep foundation of the rock. But high above the mountain, the sea, and the peaks of rock, the eternal ornamentation blooms silently from the dark depths of the universe."</i></p>

      <div align="right"> Rudolf Otto</div>

      <p> <br> The German philosopher, Immanuel Kant, once wrote that the entire enterprise of philosophy

can be seen as orbiting an attempt to answer four fundamental questions: What can I know?

What ought I to do? What may I hope for? What is a human being? He went on to say that the

answers to the first three are all contained in the answer to the fourth: what is a human being?

Ultimately, what a person can know, ought to do and hope for is determined in the final instance

by whom and what a person is. As such, human history is in the surest sense a history of the

innumerable questions of mankind, not only about the nature of reality and the gods, but of those

questions humanity has asked about itself. With Golden Age Rising, Daniella Mooney actively

prompts and directs this ancient interrogation of what it means to be human, to have

consciousness, to be in and of the world and our relation to each other and nature and ourselves.

“Whatever it is you’re trying to create”, says Mooney “should be an answer to a question. It’s

important to ask relevant questions.” So it is, and so she does. In particular: What can, do and

should we hold as divine or sacred? What is a symbol, a ritual, a myth? What is their value?

What purpose do they serve? What is the numinous? What is transcendence? What is a human

being? These are questions that stand in marked contrast with the modern, ‘neuroscientific’

mood of egocentric platitudes and analytical ennui, and resolutely so. Indeed, for Mooney the

‘relevant’ questions are decidedly not those being asked in the era of easy answers and for

precisely that reason: they are not easy, perhaps not even definitively answerable. What they

require is not bromidic navel-gazing, but something altogether more difficult: the courage of

being open to the mysterious, to the guidance of visceral wisdom; the will to meaning, and the

readiness to be swallowed by the abyss.


<br>Golden Age Rising is in effect a kind of initiation, a ritual that leads, if only we were open to it,

to a genuine awareness of our connection with nature, humanity and our own, deeper selves. The

scope is certainly immense and the work surges with referential substance, but it is by no means

opaque. It engages with the thinking of Carl Jung, Joseph Campbell, Rudolph Otto, Friedrich

Nietzsche, René Daumal and Mircea Eliade (to name but a few) and integrates myth, science,

psychoanalysis, nature, the unconscious, the divine and the anthropic. It is concerned with

connection, with the transcendent, “the ground of being” as Campbell called it, or as I will refer

to it from here on out: the numinous. What it is not concerned with is abstract intellectualism and

obscurity. Mooney is in complete control of her subject, has understood it fully and while not

spelling in out, wants us to understand it too. She is that rare kind of artist, and Golden Age

Rising, by extension, that rare work of art that does not underestimate the audience, does not

point an indifferent and mocking finger, does not forgo craft in preference of concept, is

simultaneously personal and universal, and has at its core something very meaningful to say.


<br> The following discussion tries to paint, in very broad strokes, a view of some of the overreaching

thoughts and ideas present in Mooney’s Golden Age Rising, with particular reference made to the

work of Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell. This is by no means an exegesis; the aim is not to

ascribe specific meaning or to propose intended meaning, but to extrapolate, through

examination of the thematic content, a potential map to meaning. This discussion does not and

could not ‘explain away’ the experience, nor is it a substitute for the experience itself. If

anything, these observations are mere annotations in the margins of a master work that aims for

nothing less than to link human nature with the nature of the cosmos, and suggesting, as I will

discuss later, that this connection is absolutely vital for humanity to prevail.

<p><b> The Numinous</b> </p>
<p> Golden Age Rising, as I’ve already remarked, is primarily concerned with the notion of the

numinous. It seems to me then that the best place to start is with a comprehensive definition of

this word, numinous, derived from the Latin “numen” meaning “divine presence”. In the most

literal sense, numen means “a nod of the head”, referring to the divine making its presence

known as if by “nodding” in our direction. As the preeminent Greco-Roman scholar, Herbert

Rose, explained, the word (numen) is a passive formation, thus referring not to the divinity that

nods or even the nod itself, but to “that which is produced by nodding”, in other words, it refers

to the expression of divine power, not the power itself. The divine presence is not personified

and should therefore not be taken as a synonym for “god”. The term was popularised in the

1920s by the acclaimed scholar of comparative religion, Rudolf Otto, whose work had a

profound influence on many eminent thinkers, including Mircea Eliade and Joseph Campbell. 

<br> I quote the following from Otto’s Das Heilige (The Idea of the Holy): </p>

<p> <i> "This mental state [the numinous] is perfectly sui generis [of its

own kind and order] and irreducible to any other; and therefore,

like every absolutely primary and elementary datum, while it

admits of being discussed, it cannot be strictly defined. There is

only one way to help another to an understanding of it. He must

be guided and led on by consideration and discussion of the

matter through the ways of his own mind, until he reaches the

point at which ‘the numinous’ in him perforce begins to stir, to

start into life and into consciousness. We can cooperate in this

process by bringing before his notice all that can be found in

other regions of the mind, already known and familiar, to

resemble, or again to afford some special contrast to, the

particular experience we wish to elucidate. Then we must add:

‘This X of ours is not precisely this experience, but akin to this

one and opposite to that other, cannot you now realize for

yourself what it is?’ In other words our X cannot, strictly

speaking, be taught; it can only be evoked, awakened in the mind,

as everything that comes ‘of the spirit’ must be awakened."</i></p>

<p> Golden Age Rising offers, in essence, precisely the kind of cooperation and guidance Otto talks

about, “led on by consideration and discussion,” that may lead to awakening in the mind an

apprehension of the numinous. Mooney’s sculptures, their language being the invoked

symbolism of the temple, of the unconscious and the atmosphere of myth, are in this sense

catalysts of the numinous – and therein rests the secret of their force. One gets the feeling,

moving among them, that these are perhaps not sculptures at all, but sacred objects that, though

the participation of an initiate, acquire power through association; a power that does not reside in

the symbol itself but in the reflection on meaning, and the participant’s relation to that meaning,

by which access to the numinous may become possible. This, in short, is the power of myth.

Which then begs the question: What is a myth?</p>

<p><b> Myth and Nature</b> </p>

<p> A young woman had an experience while walking along the seashore, looking out over the

waves. Her account of the experience is as follows:</p>

<p><i>"I watched the ocean for a long time, watched the waves so long

that I felt the presence of gods. I understood Poseidon. The ocean

felt alive to me. I realized why there had to be a figure to personify

these forces. I understood why there has to exist a god of

everything - trees, mountains, and so forth: a spirit of things that is

present, but not present to be seen unless you create a special

openness to it."</i></p>
<p> The incident, relayed to the psychoanalyst Michael Vannoy-Addams by one of his patients, is

contemporary; the experience, however, is as ancient as consciousness itself, indeed, the very

birthplace of the gods. As Karl Popper says of the ancient Greeks, “when they saw the high

waves of the seas they said: ‘Poseidon is angry’”. Rather than explain the sight scientifically in

terms of friction between the air and the surface of the water, the Greeks personified (or deified)

the ocean as “Poseidon”, god of the sea, whose temperament is expressed through the elemental

forces: air and water; the wind and the waves. <br>

In the first instance then, myths are animistic metaphors that arise from experience of the

numinous through nature; they are personifications of natural phenomena (the sea, the moon, the

seasons) weaved by ancient man into symbolic narratives about the workings of the cosmos. One

such narrative pertinent to a discussion of Golden Age Rising is the myth of Demeter and

Persephone. <br>

The story goes as follows: Persephone, the daughter of Demeter, Greek goddess of agriculture

and fertility, was out gathering flowers on the plains of Nysa when Hades, the god of death and

the underworld, abducted her and forced her to become his queen. Heartbroken, Demeter scoured

the earth looking for Persephone, and in her anguish caused the rain to cease and the rivers to dry

up. The fields and forests withered and died, and the suffering people of earth were set to starve.

Finally, having grown weary of the world’s wailing and Demeter’s pleas, Zeus gave in and

allowed Persephone to leave the underworld, guided by Hecate, the old and wise, to be reunited

with her mother at Eleusis. The rains returned and the earth became fertile and prosperous once

more. This was the first spring. <br>

Before her release however, spiteful Hades tricked Persephone into eating pomegranate seeds,

knowing that anyone who ate or drank in the underworld was by the Fates’ decree obliged to

remain there for all eternity. As a compromise, Persephone was compelled to return to the

underworld for a portion of every year (one month for every seed she ate), during which time

Demeter would miss her daughter, and in her sadness cause no rain to fall and the earth to grow

cold and barren. When Persephone returned to the surface, Demeter was joyful once more, and

resumed caring for the earth; and so the seasons were born.<br>

The loss of Persephone is thus rendered as the equivalent of the annual Greek dry season, and the

drought itself is explained as Demeter’s sorrowful search, just as spring is her joy at

Persephone’s return. This is the first aspect of myth, the cosmological aspect. The second aspect

is the psychological.</p>

<p><b> Myth and the Collective Unconscious</b> </p>
<p>For Carl Jung mythological motifs are structural elements of the psyche. These motifs, according

to Jung, appear in individuals who have no prior mythological knowledge. Such motifs, he says,

have emerged in individuals to whom all knowledge of this kind was absolutely impossible. He

infers that the occurrence of these mythological motifs is not an indirect derivation but an

immediate, spontaneous, autonomous manifestation, “independent of tradition”. Jung concludes

that “‘myth-forming’ structural elements must be present in the unconscious psyche”, that is to

say, the unconscious is intrinsically mythopoeic, or myth-making. These structural elements that

manifest as mythological motifs are what Jung calls the “archetypes of the collective

unconscious”.<br>

According to Jung, there are two dimensions to the unconscious, one personal, and the other

collective. “The collective unconscious so far as we can say anything about it at all - appears,”

Jung says, “to consist of mythological motifs.” We are not only individuals with our unconscious

intentions related to a specific social environment. We are also representatives of the human

race, and that universality is in us whether we know it or not. According to Jung “the whole of

mythology could be taken as a sort of projection of the collective unconscious”. I quote the

following from his Psychological Types:</p>

<p><i>"The other part of the unconscious is what I call the impersonal or

collective unconscious. As the name indicates, its contents are not

personal but collective; that is, they do not belong to one

individual alone but to a whole group of individuals, and generally

to a whole nation, or even to the whole of mankind. These contents

are not acquired during the individual’s lifetime but are products

of innate forms and instincts. Although the child possesses no

inborn ideas, it nevertheless has a highly developed brain which

functions in a quite definite way. This brain is inherited from its

ancestors; it is a deposit of the psychic functioning of the whole

human race. The child therefore brings with it an organ ready to

function in the same way that it has functioned throughout human

history. In the brain the instincts are preformed, and so are the

primordial images which have always been the basis of man’s

thinking – the whole treasure-house of mythological motifs."</i></p>
<p>For Jung the living, conscious individual condition is merely a personal variation on one of the

many collective themes of the eternal “human condition”. An experience, in the conscious world,

of these collective mythological motifs or “archetypes” gives the individual a place and meaning

in the span of the generations; the individual is liberated from isolation and restored to

wholeness. The individual no longer exists in “not so splendid isolation” but in affinity with the

collective. In short, from an archetypal perspective, a human existence is a “mythic” existence. <br>

In this view then, the myth of Persephone and Demeter are linked to the Mother/Daughter

archetypes. They are both projections of the unconscious’ “participation in the maternal psyche

on the one hand, while on the other it reaches across to the daughter psyche”. As every mother

contains her daughter in herself and every daughter her mother, every woman has the experience

of extending backwards into her mother, and her mother’s mother and all the mothers before

that, and forwards into her daughter, and the generations to follow. When these ties are

consciously experienced, it arouses in women an understanding of life as a continuum, an

interconnected existence, ever occurring and recurring, eternalised through the generations. She

experiences the eternal in her temporary self, and comes to exist outside of time; in a sense, she

becomes immortal. The experience is not limited to the individual, but leads to a symbolic

resurrection of her ancestors. The finite individual becomes a conduit through which the

generations of the past and future flow, limitless and always returning. Persephone’s rebirth is

therefore not only symbolic of the seasonal cycle and the rejuvenation of nature, but also of the

eternal life force that flows through all generations, begot as they beget.</p>

<p><b> Myth and the Metaphysical</b> </p>
<p>There is yet another aspect to myth: The metaphysical, or as Joseph Campbell called it, the

transcendent aspect. Many of Campbell’s key concepts are closely related to Jung, however, he

distinguishes himself from the psychoanalysts by claiming that myth is not a spontaneous

product of the unconscious but the themes and images of the unconscious reflected upon,

interpreted and knowingly made into myth, for the participation of all. “The old teachers knew

what they were saying” Campbell writes in his foreword to The Hero’s Journey. Myth, he says,

should be seen as a collection of conscious and controlled statements that have been created

“with the picture-language of the unconscious” in order to teach a metaphysical truth. <br>

According to Campbell the creators knew that myth was only a picture-language. The masses

may have believed that it was all true and that the symbols were referring to real deities, but the

enlightened few who created the myths were conscious of its true point of reference: a

metaphysical “ubiquitous force”, which he would later refer to as ‘the transcendent’. He writes: </p>

<p><i>"[A mythic image is] a metaphor, and the metaphor points to two

ends: one is psychological – that’s why the dream is metaphoric;

the other is metaphysical. Now, dream is metaphoric of the

structures in the psyche, and your dream will correspond to the

level of psychological realization that you are operating on. The

metaphysical, on the other hand, points past all

conceptualizations, all things, to the ultimate depth. When the two

come together, when psyche and metaphysics meet, then you have

a real myth."</i></p>
<p>For Campbell the prime function of mythology and rite is to supply the symbols that carry the

human spirit forward, in counteraction to those forces that restrain it. He stresses that where

dreams are spontaneously generated by the unconscious, myths have been consciously created by

myth-makers. The figures in dreams and myths originate from the same unconscious wells of

fantasy, but the creators of myth intentionally used the picture language of the unconscious to

convey a metaphysical message. The language “has to be studied in order to be read”, writes

Campbell “as it has been studied, clarified, and enriched by the poets, prophets, and visionaries

through the ages”. According to Campbell, Homer, Dante, Zarathustra, Tai Tsung and the like

were not “bad scientists making misstatements about the weather, or neurotics reading dreams

into the stars, but masters of the human spirit teaching the wisdom of death and life”, with mythmotifs

as their lexicon. As he writes in The Power of Myth: </p>

<p><i>"Myths put us in touch with a plane of reference that goes past your

mind and into your very being, into your very gut. The ultimate

mystery of being and nonbeing transcends all categories of

knowledge and thought. Yet that which transcends all talk is the

very essence of your own being, so you’re resting on it and you

know it. The function of mythological symbols is to give you a

sense of ‘Aha! Yes. I know what it is, it’s myself.’ This is what it’s

all about, and then you feel a kind of centering, centering,

centering all the time. And whatever you do can be discussed in

relationship to this ground of truth. Though to talk about it as truth

is a little bit deceptive because when we think of truth we think of

something that can be conceptualized. It goes past that."</i></p>
<p> Campbell believes we can penetrate this plane of reference by using active imagination, in other

words, through symbols and ritual. A symbol, firstly, is “a sign that points past itself to a ground

of meaning and being that is one with the consciousness of the beholder”. What we learn in myth

is about ourselves as part of the being of the world. Campbell frequently stated that to read a

myth correctly one must make it “transparent to the transcendent”. If a symbol impedes

transcendence by stopping at itself, it turns you into a worshipper and hasn’t opened you the

mystery of your own being.<br>

A ritual is the enactment of a myth, and through the enactment it brings to mind the fundamental

implications of the act that you are engaged in. Ritual is an occasion to comprehend and reflect

on what we’re doing so that we can participate in the energy of life. “That”, says Campbell “is

what rituals are for; you do things with intention, and not just in the animal way, ravenously,

without knowing what you’re doing”.<br>

Myth then, properly understood, refers not only to natural phenomena and the dynamics of the

psyche but to a transcendent dimension as well, being simultaneously a projection of the

collective unconscious and a mirror in which the individual can see themselves reflected. The

symbols found in myths stem from the unconscious; the meaning of myth, however, is not

psychological at all but metaphysical. Furthermore, myths have this metaphysical meaning

because the mythmakers created the myths consciously with this metaphysical meaning in mind.

They are vitalised through ritual and symbolism, tools for establishing a connection between the

physical and the numinous, and do not hold any power themselves. The connection, the access to

meaning, becomes blocked when the images are insisted upon as final terms in themselves. The

landscape of the myth is the landscape of the human spirit. The first function of a living

mythology is to guide the imagination beyond the brink of resistance to the seat of energy within

the soul; to awaken and maintain awe, humility and respect in recognition of the ultimate

mystery, from which, as it says in the Upanishads, “words turn back”.</p>
<p><b> Initiation and Transcendence</b></p>
<p>At the beginning of spring every year, the ancient Greek cult of Demeter and Persephone held

initiation ceremonies, called the Eleusinian Mysteries. The ceremony represented the myth of the

abduction of Persephone in a cycle with three phases: the “descent”, the “search” and the

“ascent”, with the main focus being the “ascent” of Persephone and the reunion with her mother

at Eleusis. The enactment of the myth through symbolic ritual is intended to lead to

transcendence, the meaning of which is defined by Campbell as “that which goes beyond all

concepts and conceptualisation, or that which lies beyond all conceptualisation”. Our life is the

experience of transcendent energies; we don’t know where our lives come from, but we can

experience them. This experience is what the Eleusian Mysteries were all about: after going deep

within one’s own unconscious, the neophyte is able to break through to a realisation that he or

she contains a divine spark – is able, in other words, to experience the numinous. <br>

For Campbell this ritual is a magnification of the universal formula represented in rites of

passage, a formula he called “the hero’s journey” and which he shows to be a common theme

found in all mythologies throughout history: A hero ventures forth from the world of everyday

life into the territory of supernatural wonder; he encounters fantastic forces and a victory with a

particular personal inflection is won. The hero returns from this mysterious adventure with new

powers and wisdom, which he is able to use for the good of his fellow man. Campbell labels

these three stages ‘Separation’, ‘Initiation’ and ‘Return’. He based this three-way structure on

Arnold van Gennep’s theory about rites of passage. In most rites of passage, according to van

Gennep, the novice is separated from his community (separation stage); undergoes a series of

tests or ordeals with an aim to transform him (transition stage); and is brought back to his or her

everyday surroundings, reborn (incorporation stage).<br>

For Campbell, the true reference of the hero motif is exactly such a process. That’s why the

events of the journey are bizarre and unreal; they represent psychological not physical triumphs.

“The passage”, he writes “may be over ground, incidentally; but fundamentally it is inward –

into depths where obscure resistances are overcome, and long lost, forgotten powers are

revivified and made available for the transfiguration of the world”. <br>

There are unmistakable parallels between Campbell’s idea of the transcendent hero and Jung’s

concept of individuation, the point at which a person’s psyche is no longer differentiated, but

becomes an integrated whole. Incidentally, Jung also wrote about individuation as a process of

“turning inward” and also identified three stages to the process: the containment/nurturance (or

maternal) stage; the adapting/adjusting (or paternal) stage; and finally the centering/integrating

(or individual) stage; the point at which we are in direct experience of the “unus munus” or “one

world”. For Jung this is not merely an abstract metaphysical realm, but something one can

experience. It not only constitutes the evolutionary history of human consciousness (what Jung

sometimes referred to as the two-million-year-old human being within us) but lies at the heart of

all spiritual intimations as to the essential oneness of life: the unus mundus, the satori experience

of Buddhism or Mushahada in Sufism, there are many others. Jung characterises this kind of

experience as a mystical experience, and calls the outlook that such an experience leads to “the

sacred view”. “At this supreme point”, he writes “physical science, psychology and theology all

coalesce”.</p>
<p><b>Sacred Objects</b></p>
<p>


Golden Age Rising, collectively and in each of the individual seven works, is a view from the

supreme point, where indeed, everything coalesces. Mooney’s work is not representational, that

is to say, these are not reenactments of traditional myths, or depictions of Jungian archetypes or

simply symbolic objects that “stand for” something else. The sculptures are themselves very real

things, born out of a very real journey, that nod in the direction of the transcendent. As I said in

the beginning, if one means to grasp them in full, it would make more sense to regard them not

as sculptures only, but as sacred objects, as creations at once indicating and belonging to the

realm of the numinous. There is no one point of entry, for Mooney is engaged on every level:

mythological, cosmological, psychological, scientific and spiritual.<br>

For example, if we regard The Road to Eleusis with Demeter and Persephone with the requisite

openness, we find that it speaks to everything discussed so far, and even more beyond:

What looks like three speleothems are in fact wooden carvings made to look like crystal cave

formations, down to the minutest detail. Everything’s there: The “three” (whether we read them

as “Demeter, Persephone and Hades”, or “Descent, Search and Ascent” or the three levels of

consciousness, “Conscious, Preconscious and Unconscious” or as Campbell’s journey to the

transcendent passing through the phases of “Separation, Initiation and Return” or the phases of

individuation, or the seasons or cyclical feminine time) – are three. Their context is

simultaneously the material world of caves (quite literally an underworld) and trees (generally

growing on the surface, reaching for the sky) as well as the metaphorical world of “above” and

“below”, “conscious” and “unconscious”. The natural world becomes a reflection of the

psychological and spiritual dimensions, and The Road to Eleusis becomes the journey to the

transcendent that leads through the “innermost cave” of the soul. <br>

In Mount Analogue (in C) we see at first a reference to Mount Analogue: A Novel of

Symbolically Authentic Non-Euclidean Adventures in Mountain Climbing’ by René Daumal. The

implications of the literary reference are multiple and well worth investigating. On the one hand

it is referring to the numinous revealing itself to those who seek it, on the other it is a literal and

ingenious transmutation of forms, of light into sound; as well as being a form of

archeoastronomy, an ancient way of symbolically investigating or representing the movements of

the solar system. As the sun strikes the quartz crystal, the light is refracted into the various

colours of the electromagnetic spectrum. Sensors positioned around the crystal modulate the

various light waves into sound waves, and the sound alters as the crystal’s relation to the sun

changes through the course of the day. There are many ancient examples of using the shifting

position of the sun in this way, like the Abu Simbel temples in Nubia for example. The ancient

Egyptian architects positioned the doorway to the temple in such a way that only (and exactly)

on two culturally meaningful days during the year, the rays of the sun would penetrate the temple

and illuminate the sculptures on the back wall, except for the statue of Ptah, the god of the

Underworld, who always remained in the dark. <br>

We see a similar link with celestial movement and symmetry in Spring Equinox, 21st September,

where the balance between night and day is rendered in a kind of geometric petroform that also

resembles a yantra and the Eye of Providence, usually associated with Freemasonry. The

Masonic link is again echoed in And So Be It, which is a rendering of ‘and so mote it be’, the

common ritual phrase used in Masonic rites, and also the literal meaning of ‘Amen’.

Symmetry in nature is referenced throughout Golden Age Rising, as with Fool’s Gold, for

example. It is a literal amplification of the natural condition of pyrite, a sulfide mineral that

manifests, by virtue of its molecular structure, as a conglomerate of geometrically perfect cubes.

Or as in Porcelain Catenary Arch with Yogi De Beer, which demonstrates the parabolaresembling

“perfect curve” created by gravity when a chain is suspended between two poles of

equal length. An inverted catenary arch, as the one Mooney has created in Golden Age Rising, is

so structurally sound that it requires no external support or stabilising force, as is majestically

demonstrated, for example, by the Gateway Arch in St. Louis in the United States. We see this

“fearful symmetry” referenced again in Seven Sermons to the Dead, with one of the small

sculptures containing a logarithmic spiral, often called the golden spiral and closely related to the

golden ratio, which is found everywhere in nature, including the shells of mollusks and the seed

clusters of sunflowers. <br>

Numeric symbols are to be found throughout Golden Age Rising as well, most prominently the

number seven, the most symbolic number of all, found all over the world in nearly all religions

and mythologies. To name but a few: in Genesis it takes God seven days to create the universe;

the Buddha is said to have taken seven steps when he was born; there are seven chakras and the

classical model of the solar system held seven bodies, including the sun and the moon. There are

seven sculptures in Mooney’s collection and one of them is called Seven Sermons to the Dead,

which is itself a reference to an obscure record of Jung’s early discoveries and meditations, and a

monumentally interesting work in its own right.<br>

Carefully considered and consciously crafted mythologems abound in Golden Age Rising. I have

briefly referred to a few of them, but I encourage every participant (for such we become when

engaging with Mooney’s work) to investigate for themselves the layers upon layers of content,

references and meaning. It is a marvelous and rewarding adventure that one soon discovers leads

ever onward, ever outward; for its landscape is that of the universe, the mythopoeic wells of the

unconscious and the human spirit, and as such it is boundless.</p>
<p><b>The Fall and Rise of the Golden Age</b></p>
<p>There is an auspicious, almost prophetic quality to Golden Age Rising, evoked at the outset by

the sense of promise contained in its title. On one level one could see it as referring to the Satya

Yuga and the great cycles, to Arcadia, the Messianic Age, to heaven on earth and all the other

projections of a world in harmony, but as we know, Mooney is not concerned with symbolic

projections in themselves, but with that which lies beyond the symbols, that transcendent

dimension of meaning which the symbols are merely pointing at. In this sense is Golden Age

Rising is speaking to what Mircea Eliade called “eternal return”, the idea that myths and rituals

and reflection on their meaning, can bring one back to the sacred, can put one in communion

with the holy other, and that the whole world longs for this reconnection, however much the

contrary is insisted upon. As he writes in Ordeal by Labyrith: “The crises of modern man are to a

large extent religious ones, insofar as they are an awakening of his awareness to an absence of

meaning.”<br>

The implication is that we have lost our connection with nature, with the ground of being and the

sacred. That it may well be that the very high incidence of neuroticism in modern man follows

from the decline of effective spiritual aid, which is not what modern consumerism or religion

offers. We have willfully resected the spiritual from our worldview and our sense of self, and

have been looking for it ever since.<br>

“Do what he will,” writes Eliade “[the profane man] is an inheritor. He cannot utterly abolish his

past, since he himself is a product of his past. He forms himself by a series of denials and

refusals, but he continues to be haunted by the realities that he has refused and denied. To

acquire a world of his own, he has desacralised the world in which his ancestors lived; but to do

so he has been obliged to adopt an earlier type of behavior, and that behavior is still emotionally

present in him, in one form or another, ready to be reactualised in his deepest being.”<br>

Nietzsche too warned of an onset of nihilism and the oppressive terror of a world without

meaning that he saw following the spiritual death of man; famously expressed in the generally

misunderstood phrase: “God is dead”. In The Birth of Tragedy he cautions that without any direct

understanding of myth, we are doomed to roam the spiritual wasteland in search of ourselves.

Conceptual abstractions like morality and history are all that will remain to us, and they are

incapable of providing fulfillment. Myth, Nietzsche says, gives us a sense of wonder and a

fullness of life that modern culture lacks, and he urges a return to our deeper selves, which are

inextricably entwined with myth and art. The true joy of life, the transcendent life of the spirit, is

the bliss of existing in connection with the ground of being and the spontaneous magic of the

living world.<br>

Golden Age Rising is, in the end, about exactly that: connection. Connection between the

artwork and the observer, the observer and the artist, the artist and her collaborators, but more

importantly, it is an urgent call for connecting with our deeper selves, with nature, with the wells

of myth and meaning and the spiritual and mysterious dimensions of our existence, for as

Wordsworth wrote:</p>

<p><i>The world is too much with us; late and soon,<br>

Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers;<br>

Little we see in Nature that is ours;<br>

We have given our hearts away, a sordid boon!<br>

This Sea that bares her bosom to the moon;<br>

The winds that will be howling at all hours,<br>

And are up-gathered now like sleeping flowers;<br>

For this, for everything, we are out of tune;<br>

It moves us not. Great God! I’d rather be<br>

A Pagan suckled in a creed outworn;<br>

So might I, standing on this pleasant lea,<br>

Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn;<br>

Have sight of Proteus rising from the sea;<br>

Or hear old Triton blow his wreathèd horn.</i></p>
